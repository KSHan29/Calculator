# Calculator

Simple calculator to carry out basic arithmetic operations. Calculations are done are either pressing the `=` sign or any arithmetic operator after two numbers have already been keyed in. Every subsequent press of the arithmetic operator evaluates the equation as well as inputs the next operator.

Calculations truncates the decimal points to `4 d.p.`. `AC` clears the whole entry while `C` clears the last number entered, if any. The maximum characters allowed to be keyed in to the calculator is 10.

Inputs can be registered through clicking the buttons or by typing. For special operators, use `Control` + `Backspace` for `AC` and `~` for `plus-minus`.
